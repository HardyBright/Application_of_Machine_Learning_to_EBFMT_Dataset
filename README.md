This project analyzes the Exposure Based Face Memory Test Responses (EBFMT) dataset using various data processing techniques. The data was compiled as a part of a test and survey designed by The Open-Source Psychometrics Project (https://openpsychometrics.org) to study Prosopagnosia, or “face blindness”. The dataset was uploaded to Kaggle by by Lucas Greenwell. 

This repository is organized into subfolders for various parts of the project. The dataset is in its original CSV, tab delininated format and organized into the data folder along with the codebook.txt file created by the project. Within the items subfolder are the images the The Open-Source Psychometrics Project used to administer their test. 

The Jupyter notebook and any generated figures in this project is saved to the src and figures folders respectively. The written project report is saved to the report folder.
